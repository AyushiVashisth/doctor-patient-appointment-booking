Creation of a web application for doctor-patient appointment booking. It involves both backend and frontend development using Node.js and a library/framework of choice, respectively. Key features include integrating Google Calendar for appointment scheduling, ensuring secure authentication using JWT or session-based methods, and establishing role-based authorization. A database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) will store user and appointment data. The front end must have user-friendly interfaces for registration, login, appointment booking, and a doctor's dashboard. Optional features include notifications, appointment rescheduling, and a doctor search function. Code readability and adherence to best practices are emphasized in the evaluation process. Functionality takes precedence over UI design.

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

**Backend Development:**
1. RESTful API using Node.js and Express.
2. Routes for user authentication, appointment booking, and management.
3. Utilizes a choice of database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
4. Integration of Google Calendar API for appointment scheduling.

**Frontend Development:**
1. Utilizes any frontend library or framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
2. User-friendly interfaces for doctor and patient registration and login.
3. Intuitive forms for patients to book appointments, including Google Calendar integration.
4. Dashboard for doctors to manage appointments, synchronized with Google Calendar.

**Authentication:**
1. Secure authentication system for doctors and patients.
2. Uses techniques like JWT or session-based authentication.
3. Access is restricted to authenticated users only.

**Authorization:**
1. Role-based permissions (e.g., doctor, patient, admin).
2. Access control based on user roles.
3. Authorized users can modify appointments and access specific information.

**Optional Features:**
1. Email or push notifications for appointment reminders.
2. Patient's ability to cancel or reschedule appointments.
3. Search functionality to find doctors based on speciality, location, or availability.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Proper backend functionality and RESTful API implementation.
2. Secure authentication system (JWT or session-based).
3. Efficient database usage.
4. Successful Google Calendar integration.
5. Proper implementation of authorization and access control.
6. Error handling and input validation.
7. Optional features (if implemented).
8. Emphasis on readable code and coding standards.
9. Functionality prioritized over UI design.
